# JavaScript Execution Model & The Event Loop

The following repo has A Google slides presentation About how JavaScript is executed & the event loop - this is a longer presentation.

You'll find:
- A PDF of the presentation, with speaker notes written in a conversational style, so you would be able to just give this talk else where with zero changes if you want to! (with attribution of course :wink:)
- A markdown transcript.

Here are links to the actual Google slides document:
- [In Google Slides Editor](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CptgMN0vDR-JqUPCqh4wNjmyN5zgOixdV8t_YflUu28/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Published Version (speaker notes not visible)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSPfbOEpKppBC-6c_Wwb9pFU6umFWCnvpQnLQkN_jBoE1HNVHEG9OKFNp8fBA-dAhD-4w25MiwDFH-y/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).

Note that the presentation *deliberately* does not mention the promise queue - the presentation is targeted at experienced programmers unfamiliar with JavaScript omitting this extra detail makes the presentation easier to grok for the target audience. In a Q & A session after presentation it may be worth mentioning the promise queue once the concept of the event loop has been established.

If you do find any of this useful let me know!
